# Bulma-UI-for-sketch
Bulma Sketch Library was made by [dungeonfog](https://www.dungeonfog.com) to make the life of UI/UX designers simpler.
It contains the most *Elements*, *Forms* and *Components* from the [Bulma CSS framework](https://www.bulma.io).

## How to use
The recommended use of this document is to adapt it first to fit you CI by changing the *color variables* (especially ***primary***) and then the *text & layer styles* in this particular order.

After that use that edited document as a **Library** in your project. Of course you can link this as is as a library at the cost of flexibility.

All *Elements*, *Forms* and *Components* have their respective pages in this document and come with example in case they are not self explanatory.

## Technical notes
This project was created with **Sketch 71** and supports all current features of this version. That includes layouts, text & layer styles, and color variables. The components are based on **v0.9.2 of BULMA**.

#### Known issues
Most of the UI and styles are directly taken and named after things in BULMA. Though not every UI component like most *layout* and *columns* have been implemented and were omitted due sketch's limitation in that regards. The common sense of the designer is required. Also the buttons have been simplified in comparison to the technical implementation but can be adapted as necessary (duh).

#### Typography
The default text sizes are defined as styles in *color* and *align* (*left*/*center*/*right*) variants. All other (like responsive) styles have been omitted out of simplicity. They can be easily created by duplicating an existing style and adapt it.

The default font family used by this document is Helvetica Neue. When you change the styles make sure to check all *Elements*, *Forms* and *Components* since the paddings will change. Unfortunately sketch can't handle that automatically and it needs to be fixed by hand.  It is not necessary to fix but if perfect designs with correct paddings are needed, this has to be adjusted manually.

## Font Awesome
Thanks to [Font Awesome]() for their icons used by BULMA and hence in this document. All used icons can be found an the page *Placeholders and helpers*.
